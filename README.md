# TravelTime
Calculating Travel time using OpenTripPlanner and Google API 
The methodology is stated in Lahoorpoor and Levinson (2019)

# OpenTripPlanner
This code is based on the Rafael H M Pereira's code for measuring travel time using OTP as API and runing the python script with jython. More details on: https://github.com/rafapereirabr/otp-travel-time-matrix.git

How to run the script in terminal is:

jython -Dpython.path=otp.jar travel-time.py

# Google API

This code is base on the different resources on the web and Google Maps Distance Matrix API:
